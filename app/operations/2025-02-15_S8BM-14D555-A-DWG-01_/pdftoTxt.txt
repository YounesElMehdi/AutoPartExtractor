Twisted CAN network circuits, consisting of 2 to 4 wires (circuit id beginning VDB as reported in the DSI 
file), that are manufactured internally, should be manufactured according to the requirementslaid out in 
the standard ED-0763. 
A spot tape should be applied to the crossover nearest to the connector, to prevent unravelling of the 
twist, with the wires being plugged to the connector, ensuring no other circuits are routed between the 
wires.

For Non-CAN twisted circuits (identified as T2 [multicore section] without a 'VDB' prefixed wire ID in the DSi) 
that are manufactured internally, should be manufactured according to the requirements laidout in the

Twisted Flexray circuits (wire material = FRTH, FRTM or FRTL reported in the DSI file), should be 
manufactured according to the requirements laid out in the standard STJLR.18.081.
A spot tape shouldbe applied to the crossover nearest to the connector, to prevent unravelling of the twist,
with those wires being plugged last to the connector cavities to make sure that other  wires do not get 
mixed between.
